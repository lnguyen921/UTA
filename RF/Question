What is attenuation?
  - Reduction of a signal's strength or intensity as it passes through a medium.
  - The goal is add attenuation as it will increate stability.

Why attenuation after amplification?
  - Prevent compression later in the chain in cases where you have a varying input level.
  - Goal is to have circuit remain linear and avoid NF degradation.
  - Reduces signal level and noise by the same factor because noise added in the first stage is impossible to reduce later in the system.
  - Noise is also added from the attenuator compoenent(mostly thermal)

Attenuation after amplification?
  - Amplifier can be unstable with certain loads which result in power reflected back to amplifier. 
  

What is casecaded noise figure? How is this related to attenuation and amplification? 
  - reduce ripple caused by impedance mismatch over a wide bandwidth so it's always on the input of a power meter.
