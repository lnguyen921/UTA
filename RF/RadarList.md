1. dB vs dBm
  - dB is the ratio between two power levels
  - dBm is an absolute power level with reference of 0 dBm = 1 milliwatt. Also, a dBW is an absolute power level with reference of 0 dBW = 1 watt. You may see either depending on application.
  - If i say 0 dB, then all I know is that the two power levels im comparing are equal. It says nothing about the absolute power levels of these two signals.
  - If I say 0dBm, then I mean 1 milliwatt precisely.
  - Therefore, be careful when adding numbers. X dBW + Y dB = (X+Y) dBW
  - However, X dBW + Y dBW does NOT equal (X+Y) dBW! I have see this last part as a interview question many times, so be careful with your units
